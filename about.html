I received my Bachelor's degree in <b>Computer Science</b> at <a href="http://www.upv.es/en">UPV</a> in 2015. Two years later I got my <b>MSc in Artificial Intelligence</b> from <a href="https://www.ub.edu/">UB</a>, <a href="https://www.upc.edu/ca">UPC</a> and <a href="https://www.urv.cat/en/">URV</a>. I recently completed my <b>PhD on Learning Video representations</b> at <a href="http://www.cvc.uab.es/?page_id=223" target="blank">HuPBA</a> lab. under Prof. <a href="https://sergioescalera.com/" target="blank">Sergio Escalera</a>'s supervision. My main <u>research interests</u> include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I am especially interested in learning algorithms, understanding and analyzing their perks for a more informed development of new techniques. I find self-supervised, multi-modal and generative approaches particularly interesting.

    From a very early age I wanted to be an inventor. As I grew older I gradually narrowed it down to AI. So I set out to study Computer Science and got my bachelor degree at Universitat Politècnica de València (<a href="http://www.upv.es/en">UPV</a> - 2015), where I started working on <b>NLP</b>, performing sentiment analysis on Twitter content. From there I came to Barcelona, where I’m currently based, to study a Master on Artificial Intelligence. Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (<a href="https://www.upc.edu/ca">UPC</a>), Universitat de Barcelona (<a href="https://www.ub.edu/">UB</a>) and Universitat Rovila i Virgili (<a href="https://www.urv.cat/en/">URV</a>), offered a wide program, ranging from traditional symbolic AI to deep learning, going through multi-agent systems. This gave me an understanding of a plethora of AI techniques and finally allowed me to better define and understand what I was interested in: <b>the learning process</b>. This got me interested into the <b>(neuro)science</b> of human learning. Such interest peaked during my master's thesis: a <a href="https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/118121" target="blank">survey on deep video frame prediction (2018)</a>, a task which follows predictive coding ideas to train neural networks for <b>computer vision</b>. After that I jumped on a PhD under Prof. <a href="https://sergioescalera.com/" target="blank">Sergio Escalera</a>’s supervision, within the <a href="http://www.cvc.uab.es/?page_id=223" target="blank">HuPBA</a> lab. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=T5-DYyUAAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=T5-DYyUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC">My thesis</a> revolved around learning video representations. In particular, I employed the novel <b>transformer</b> architecture, focusing on analyzing human behavior in interactions. This work required a <b>multidisciplinary</b> approach, where I collaborated closely with psychologists, integrating their insights into our projects to bridge the gap between technology and behavioral science. While I’ve found that human analysis is not my preferred line of research, I have strongly enjoyed working with researchers from other fields.

    I want to better understand the learning process (what and how are these models learning) in order to design novel mechanisms that allow machines to aquire knowledge, as well as harnessing said knowledge to solve real world problems. 

    My (<em>fundamental</em>) research interests lie mostly within <b>self-supervised</b> methods (including <b>generative</b> ones), <b>reinforcement</b> learning, <b>multi-modal</b> approaches (CV + NLP), and <b>interpretable</b> models, with a particular focus on understanding and improving the learning mechanisms of AI. I think we should be working towards more <b>computationally efficient</b> architectures which are better capable of <b>generalizing</b> while requiring <b>less data</b>. This in turn, I think, is a step towards <b>democratizing AI</b>, which currently is heavily dependent on data, which in turn is not so much accessible by everyone. 

    Regarding <em>applied</em> research, I am deeply motivated to collaborate with <b>experts from diverse fields</b>, combining their knowledge with AI to develop innovative solutions to real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in applying AI to areas such as sustainable <b>agriculture and farming</b>, <b>autonomous driving</b> (for public transport and freight), <b>logistics optimization</b>, <b>clean energy production</b> (such as novel windmills or solar panels), aiding <b>scientific exploration</b>, etc. I believe that we have an incredible tool at our disposal, and despite the current hype around AI, its true potential lies in thoughtfully designed applications. By collaborating with experts across domains, I hope we can harness AI's power to truly <b>improve our quality of life while minimizing our impact the Earth</b> and its resources.

I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from Universitat Politècnica de València in 2015, and my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in 2018. In December 2023 I completed my PhD in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at Universitat de Barcelona (UB), focusing on automatic video analysis using Transformers. My (fundamental) research interests include multi-modality (CV and NLP), self-supervision and interpretability. Regarding applied development, I am eager to collaborate with experts in other fields to work towards aiding science, automatic agriculture and farming, autonomous driving for public transport, logistics management, clean energy production, etc. so together we can help in building a better world together while respecting the environment we inhabit.
