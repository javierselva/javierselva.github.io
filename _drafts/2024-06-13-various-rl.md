title: Teaching Mario to play with Reinforcement Learning
category: project
tags: ["project"]

For a long time I found Reinforcement Learning (RL) to be deeply interesting. During my PhD, however, 
I hardly had much oportunity to include it in any of my research. Now that's finished, I decided to aquaint
myself with it by trying to teach an AI to beat Super Mario Bros. This is a project I actually started while doing
my Master's in AI: we tried to solve it with an evolutionary algorithm that evolved the 
network's architecture... without much success. So I thought now's the perfect change to try again, but with RL instead.

The first step was learning a little bit about RL. I started by going through [this short guide](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html).
