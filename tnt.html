<h4> Set up Authentication GitHub token </h4>
Date: 10/18 2021</br></br>

This is actually very easy, but I've already had to search for it a couple of times, so <a href="https://docs.github.com/es/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">here it comes</a>.</br></br>

Go into GitHub > User > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens (within OAuth Apps).</br></br>

There just generate new token or renew an expired one. There are a minimum of <i>capablities</i> one must give to these tokens. But should not be too hard.</br></br>

Then simply <a href=https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git">go into the console</a> and write:</br></br>

> gh auth login</br></br>

Select Github.com; HTML; Y; and paste the token.</br></br>

<h4> Regex-replace in Latex with group capture </h4>
Date: 09/22 2021</br></br>

This may have happened to me more than one time. I was editing a Latex file and wanted, for instance, to remove a bunch of things in \textbf{<b>bold</b>} and keep them as plain text, or accept a bunch of comments (I generally mark working text in red to be later edited/removed/accepted as \textcolor{red}{lorem ipsum...}). My first idea was to use some regex expression to find all these, and somehow parametrize the content so it could be referenced from the replace field of the text editor. In this way, every <i>find-replace</i> would be unique depending on the content each instantiation of the regex in the <i>find</i> had found.
</br>
To explain the solution I'm going to be giving the following example. I have a latex table with a bunch of numbers, some in bold, some not, and want to make them all to be plain text. </br>

</br>
Very easily you can find all those instances by using
</br></br>
\\textbf{[\d].[\d]*}
</br></br>
(The starting double \\ is to scape the \ from \textbf{}). Now, somehow, I need to be able to tell the replace field to replace each instance with the matched contents in [\d].[\d]*. A quick google search finds <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Can_I_use_regular_expressions_for_%22replace_with%22%3F">this post from Overleaf</a> where they explain it should be as easy (and it is) as doing
</br></br>
Replace: /([a-z])-([a-z])/ </br>
With: /$1$2/
</br></br>
But for the life of me, I didn't know what was I doing wrong, but it was not working. I thought the parenthesis were part of a specific example, as that hyphen between both [a-z], but turns out the <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html"> parenthesis are fundamental to capture a regex grup</a>, which is what we're doing here.
</br>
So coming back to our example, the solution is:
</br></br>
Find:    \\textbf{([\d]).([\d]*)}</br>
Replace: $1.$2
