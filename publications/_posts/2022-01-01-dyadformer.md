We present the Dyadformer, a novel multi-modal multi-subject Transformer architecture to model individual and interpersonal features in dyadic interactions using variable time windows, thus allowing the capture of long-term interdependencies. Our proposed cross-subject layer  allows  the  network  to  explicitly  model  interactions among subjects through attentional operations. This proof-of-concept  approach  shows  how  multi-modality  and  joint modeling  of  both  interactants  for  longer  periods  of  time helps to predict individual attributes.
